Questions for Tim
- Torque Saturation
    - Mathematically Solve? We would need to know prooperties of motor
    - Tanh() function?
    - Or other? Regression?
- How does current drive the motor? Should we use this for torque controller? 
    - this was also mentioned in video: current vs torque graph (saturation)
- Do our assumption make sense?
- Back EMF?
- Max current? 
- Max voltage?
